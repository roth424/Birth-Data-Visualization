# Birth-Data-Visualization
 Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

Specific Requirements


Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 


A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)


Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
